Get the API key
You must have at least one API key associated with your project.

To get an API key:

Go to the Google Cloud Platform Console.
From the Project drop-down menu, select or create the project for which you want to add an API key.
From the  Navigation menu, select APIs & Services > Credentials.
On the Credentials page, click Create credentials > API key. 
The API key created dialog displays your newly created API key (an encrypted string).
Click Close. 
The new API key is listed on the Credentials page under API keys. 
(Remember to restrict the API key before using it in production.)
